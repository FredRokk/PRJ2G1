# RPI CODE
This directory contains the source code for all things RPi-related.

In order to create the module-test program, simply invoke 'make' from a cloned version of this directory. This will produce an executable file 'test' under /bin/host/release/. Alternatively, invoke 'make TARGET=target' to generate a file 'test' under /bin/target/release/, that is executable on the RPizw.
